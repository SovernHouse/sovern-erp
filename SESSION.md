## Last Updated
2026-05-15 Taiwan time. Phase 4.9b shipped (TariffRate model + admin CRUD + mobile read view).

---

## CI Status
- **Latest commits on main (newest first):**
  - `5c80429` feat(tariffs): TariffRate model + admin CRUD + mobile read view (Phase 4.9b) — CI in progress at session note time
  - `fe29ea4` fix(ai): dev-mode chat + dev-runs list double-unwrap (two bugs, one root) — green
  - `bb22fdd` feat(catalog): Product.originVariants multi-origin pricing (Phase 4.9a) — green
  - `bcd682c` feat(mobile): quotation create flow — L-035 parity catch-up (Pre-4.9) — green
  - `e8ad4e7` fix(pipeline): unwrap envelope correctly so columns are populated (hotfix) — green
  - `97a493d` feat(taxonomy): archive non-flooring product categories (C21 follow-up) — green
- **Working tree:** clean
- **Most recent deploy:** `fe29ea4` deploy green. `5c80429` deploy will follow after CI passes.
- **Backend health:** live at `https://erp.sovernhouse.co/api`
- **Tests:** 219/219 passing locally pre-push.
- **Mobile parity:** READY. Tariff rates read screen `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/tariff-rates.tsx` shipped same commit per L-035. Alex still needs to run `eas update --branch main --platform ios --environment production` from Windows for users to see it.

---

## Phase 4.9 — IN FLIGHT

Multi-origin products + tariff rates + landed-cost quotations. Ordered as 4.9a → 4.9b → 4.9c → 4.9d → 4.9e per Alex's approved sequence. Must ship before Phase 5 (offline mode).

### 4.9a — Product.originVariants — SHIPPED (`bb22fdd`, deploy green)

- Product gains `originVariants JSON NOT NULL DEFAULT []`. Variant: `{ originCountry, fobPriceUsd, priceUnit, moqOverride?, leadTimeOverride? }`.
- Backfill service `migrateProductOriginVariantsC49a.js` with sentinel `phase4_9_c1_product_origin_variants_backfilled`.
- productController create + update accept `originVariants`.
- Desktop ProductForm: add/remove origin variant rows (origin country / FOB / unit / MOQ override / lead time override).
- Mobile product detail modal: read-only origin variants list.

### 4.9b — TariffRate model + admin CRUD — SHIPPED (`5c80429`, CI running)

- Backend: `TariffRate` model (UUID, originCountry, destinationCountry, ratePercent DECIMAL(7,4), effectiveFrom, effectiveUntil, sourceNote, nullable brandCode). Controller exposes list / expiring / create / update / remove + `getCurrentTariff(origin, destination, brandCode, asOfDate)` helper for the upcoming 4.9c landed-cost flow. Routes: read = any auth user, mutations = super_admin (L-031). All mutations audited.
- Seed (`seedTariffRatesC49b.js`, sentinel `phase4_9_c2_tariff_rates_seeded`): CN→US 40.7714% + MY→US 15.5214%, both `2026-05-14` → `2026-05-15` (intentional short window so 4.9e date-warning fires immediately).
- Desktop: `/settings/tariff-rates` super-admin page. Grouped table by origin→destination, expiry badges (red expired / amber ≤7d), inline DraftRow editor, Show expired toggle. Super-admin sidebar entry.
- Mobile (L-035): `app/tariff-rates.tsx` read-only list with same expiry badges + Show expired toggle. Mutations stay desktop-super-admin only by design.
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE section added.

### Next: 4.9c — Quotation builder origin-picker + landed-cost math + PDF columns (USA destinations)

- Per quotation line item, picker selects which `Product.originVariants[]` to use → sets FOB and origin country.
- At save and at PDF render: call `getCurrentTariff(origin, 'US', brandCode)`. Compute `landedCostUnit = fob * (1 + ratePercent/100)`. Cache the snapshot (`tariffSnapshot: {ratePercent, effectiveUntil, sourceTariffRateId}`) on the QuotationItem so the quotation is immutable after send even if the live rate changes.
- New PDF columns shown when destination is USA: Origin, FOB, Tariff %, Landed/unit, Landed total.
- Mobile parity: line-item editor on `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/quotation/create.tsx` gets the same origin picker + USA landed-cost preview.

### Then: 4.9d (bulk import) → 4.9e (expiry warning UI) → Phase 5 (offline mode).

---

## Phase 4.7 — SHIPPED

Three commits closing real gaps in Phase 4.5 and adding the Drive folder structure + proactive upload-suggestion behavior. C-2 (FW signature) and the bulk of C-1 (WRITE/ACTION tools) were already live from Phase 4.5; the spec items were verified rather than redone.

### C-1 gap-closer (commit `41b60a1`, deploy green)
- send_email tool accepts optional from_email. Routes to alex@sovernhouse.co for SH context, alexflorway@gmail.com for FW/IronLite/HanHua context. Both ConnectedGoogleAccounts are active so the previous "auto-pick first active" was non-deterministic.
- getGoogleAuth(targetEmail) helper extended.
- System prompt: tighter hard refusals adds explicit lines for "delete a Brand row, ever" and "change a User role / super_admin grants or revocations" beyond the broader categories already in place.
- aiContextService system prompt: new "Sender account routing" subsection under email safety rule. Tells the model to always pass from_email explicitly and to ask Alex when the brand context is ambiguous rather than guess.

### C-3 Drive folder structure setup (commit `6b81895`, CI in progress)
- New backend/services/driveStructureSetup.js. FOLDER_TREE: 2 top-level + 6 nested folders. findOrCreateFolder helper mirrors the aiController.js pattern. setupForAccount + setupDriveStructureForAllAccounts.
- New backend/routes/adminRoutes.js. POST /api/admin/drive-setup (super_admin only, L-031). Idempotent. Returns { folderTree, accounts: { email: { path: { id, created, webViewLink } } } }.
- Server wires adminRoutes alongside brandRoutes at /api.
- Each successful account run writes admin_drive_setup AuditLog row with folderCount, createdCount, tree.
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md gets a new "Drive folder structure setup (Phase 4.7, C-3)" section.
- Bulk upload of the local IronLite Branding folder is intentionally NOT in scope (the Linux VM can't see C:\). Alex opens the returned webViewLink and drags the 5 items in via drive.google.com.

### C-4 Proactive upload suggestion (this commit)
- aiContextService system prompt: new "Proactive upload suggestion when search returns empty" paragraph. When search_drive_files returns no matches, the AI proposes an upload destination based on filename heuristics (IronLite → Brand Assets/IronLite Branding/, contract → Operations/Contracts/, PI / factory / HanHua → Operations/Factory Communications/, template → Operations/Templates/, etc.). Tells Alex he can drag-drop via drive.google.com.
- Reply template documented in the prompt so the AI is consistent.
- Refusal: never invent a Drive link when search returned nothing.
- This is pure prompt behaviour. No new tools. No mobile change required (mobile assistant uses the same /api/ai/chat backend).

---

## Phase 4.6 — SHIPPED (perf sweep)

Mobile list-perf pattern applied across 13 tab + shared screens. Standard recipe per screen:
- Row component wrapped in React.memo.
- renderItem + keyExtractor extracted to useCallback for stable refs.
- Search/status filter via useMemo (was useEffect+setFiltered double-render anti-pattern, where it applied).
- FlatList virtualization tuned: removeClippedSubviews on Android, initialNumToRender=10-12, maxToRenderPerBatch=8-10, windowSize=10.

| Commit | Files |
|---|---|
| `077b728` | dashboard.tsx (MetricCard + ModuleTile + stable handlers + memoized updated label) |
| `c2a23ac` | BrandFilterPicker (memo'd Pill + outer React.memo) + CommissionWidget (memo'd Tile + memoized fmtMoney) |
| `8f08b0c` | quotations.tsx + factories.tsx (worst setFiltered pattern, biggest win) |
| `5bf5f3b` | sales-orders.tsx + purchase-orders.tsx + invoices.tsx + triage.tsx + approvals.tsx |

Customers.tsx + leads.tsx are in `1d0b290` (originally C22 in Phase 4.5). Products.tsx already uses useMemo via C21.

### Deferred perf (Phase 5 candidates)

Lower-value tab screens with FlatList but without the worst patterns. Audit when Alex tells me perf still feels slow:
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/(tabs)/inquiries.tsx`
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/(tabs)/shipments.tsx`
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/(tabs)/expenses.tsx`
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` (messages list)
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/(tabs)/research.tsx`

Other Phase 5 perf items:
- onEndReached pagination on long lists (current screens fetch page=1 only).
- Image compression on factory / product image-bearing detail screens.
- Bundle-size audit + code splitting if cold start grows.

---

---

## Phase 4.5 — SHIPPED

Six items shipped over seven commits (including one hotfix). All sentinels confirmed on live DB; real customer + lead data untouched.

### C23 — spellcheck + autocorrect on prose inputs (commit `95ec627`, deploy green)
- FormFields.jsx primitives carry explicit spellCheck defaults: TextInput + TextArea → true, EmailInput + PasswordInput + NumberInput + CurrencyInput → false. EmailInput also drops autoCapitalize + autoCorrect.
- AI assistant chat textarea + dev-run answer textarea: spellCheck=true.
- ClientContacts.jsx email composer body + template body: spellCheck=true.
- Mobile assistant + chat composer: explicit autoCorrect + spellCheck + autoCapitalize="sentences".
- Code-like fields (search, SKU, forgot-password email) intentionally keep autoCorrect={false}.

### C21 — flooring-only catalog + super-admin toggle (commit `a9a6aac`, deploy green)
- Shared util `productCategoryFilter.js` (desktop) + `.ts` (mobile) with FLOORING_PRODUCT_TYPES = [lvt, spc, wpc, hardwood, laminate, ceramic, tile, vinyl], filterByFlooring(), useShowAllCategories() hook (localStorage / AsyncStorage).
- Settings/ProductCatalog.jsx: super-admin Show all categories checkbox + empty-state copy.
- Quotations/QuotationForm.jsx: line-item product picker uses visibleProducts. Toggle shared via storage. Fixed pre-existing em dash in label.
- Mobile app/(tabs)/products.tsx: Switch toggle (super-admin only) + composite filter via useMemo.

### C24 — refreshed FW brand signature (commit `41c2a60`, deploy green, live-verified)
- New migrateBrandSignaturesC24.js, idempotent via AuditLog sentinel `phase4_5_fw_signature_updated`. Updates Brand WHERE code='FW' signatureHtml + signatureText to Country Manager design surfacing both FlorWay (Malaysia) and Anhui HanHua (China). Calibri/Arial inline-style table.
- seedBrands.js FW row updated to match so fresh installs are coherent.
- server.js wires migration after migrateSanctionsC18.
- SH brand intentionally untouched.
- **Live verified:** FW.signatureHtml = 966 chars; AuditLog sentinel recorded at 2026-05-15 01:28:39 UTC.

### C19 v1 — AI Drive retrieval + external search docs (commit `a0cbc9a`, deploy green)
- erpToolServer.js TOOL_DEFS: rewritten search_drive_files + read_drive_file descriptions to cover brand decks, presentations, contracts, slide decks, references, drafts. Calls out name= vs query= trade-off and the requirement to surface webViewLink.
- aiContextService.js: new C19 paragraph instructing the assistant to call search_drive_files on any named-document request BEFORE saying "I can't share that".
- helpContent.js: /ai/assistant section gets "Finding documents in Drive" and "External research" subsections with trigger phrasing. Removes stale "does NOT have access to documents" line.

### C19 v2 — AI assistant WRITE + ACTION capabilities (commits `a6fc36f` + hotfix `c71eb25`, deploy green)
- 7 new MCP tools added to erpToolServer.js:
  - WRITE: update_brand, update_email_template, update_user_profile_self, update_dashboard_layout.
  - ACTION: create_scheduled_task, mark_item_complete, archive_item.
- Permission helpers: getCurrentUserOrThrow + requireSuperAdmin.
- Audit wrapper auditAiWrite writes rows with action prefix `ai_assistant_<tool_name>`, entity = affected model, entityId = row UUID, changes = before/after diff.
- Field whitelists: BRAND_WRITABLE_FIELDS, EMAIL_TEMPLATE_WRITABLE_FIELDS, USER_SELF_WRITABLE_FIELDS, ARCHIVABLE_ENTITIES. Anything outside is silently dropped.
- aiContextService.js system prompt: mandatory pre-write protocol (read current, show diff, wait for confirm, apply, report) + hard-refusal list (deletes, payment/billing edits, sanctions screening status, AuditLog mods, user roles/permissions).
- helpContent.js: Configuration changes via chat + Hard refusals subsections.
- **Hotfix `c71eb25`:** the v2 commit used literal backticks inside the system-prompt template literal, breaking parsing and failing 148 tests. Hotfix escaped them per the existing convention (\`\\\`tool\\\`\`). Backend tests now 219/219 pass.

### C20 — archive seed data + lock catalog re-seeding (commit `b6a8d82`, deploy green, live-verified)
- New migrateSeedDataC20.js. For each target (Product, ProductPrice, ProductSpecification, then 6 empty tables: Quotation/SO/PI/Invoice/PO/CommissionTracking): DROP IF EXISTS ArchivedSeed_<X>, CREATE TABLE ArchivedSeed_<X> AS SELECT *, datetime('now') AS archived_at_utc FROM <X>, then DELETE FROM <X> in FK-safe order.
- Sentinel-guarded via AuditLog action `phase4_5_seed_data_archived`. Re-run is no-op.
- seedProducts.js: short-circuits when the C20 sentinel exists, so the empty Product table never gets re-seeded with the 5 Phase 4 placeholder SKUs.
- **Live verified:** Product=0, ArchivedSeed_Product=31 rows, ArchivedSeed_ProductPrice=31 rows. Customer=5, Leads=112 (real data preserved). Sentinel at 2026-05-15 01:45:09 UTC.
- **Recovery path:** INSERT INTO Product SELECT (all columns except archived_at_utc) FROM ArchivedSeed_Product. Same shape for the other tables.

### C22 — mobile perf pass (commit `1d0b290`, CI queued at session close)
- customers.tsx + leads.tsx: row component wrapped in React.memo, search filter migrated from useEffect/setFiltered to useMemo (one render per keystroke instead of two), renderItem + keyExtractor extracted to useCallback for stable references, FlatList virtualization tuned (removeClippedSubviews on Android, initialNumToRender=12, maxToRenderPerBatch=10, windowSize=10).
- No on-device TTI numbers per the agreed "code-level fixes with reasoned narrative" scope.
- Dashboard widget memoization deferred to a follow-up commit (more widgets, deserves its own survey).

---

## What Alex still owes manually

1. **Verify on phone after Expo OTA refresh** — pull the latest update on Expo Go, walk the customer + lead lists, and confirm scrolling feels smoother. C22 changes are JS-only so no native rebuild needed.

2. **Walk the AI assistant verification checklist (Phase 4.5, C19):**
   - "Show me the IronLite Branding deck" — should call search_drive_files name=, return a clickable webViewLink.
   - "Update the FW signature to put HanHua first" — should show before/after, wait for "yes", call update_brand, write `ai_assistant_update_brand` to AuditLog.
   - "Flights TPE to LAX next Friday morning" — WebSearch result.
   - "Send Mr. Lee an email asking for the updated FOB list" — preview-confirm before send_email.
   - "Remind me to follow up with Acme next Tuesday 10am" — echo Taipei time, wait for confirm, call create_scheduled_task, write `ai_assistant_create_scheduled_task`.

3. **Empty product catalog is expected** — the 31 demo Products were archived in C20. Add real flooring products via /settings/products. The flooring-only filter from C21 is on by default; flip "Show all categories" to surface non-flooring schema fields.

4. **AuditLog audit query** — to see every AI-initiated change, run:
   ```sql
   SELECT action, entity, entity_id, datetime(created_at) FROM AuditLog WHERE action LIKE 'ai_assistant_%' ORDER BY created_at DESC;
   ```

5. **Mobile app mobile follow-up** (deferred): dashboard widget memoization is the next Phase 4.6 perf pass. Long-list pagination (onEndReached) is a Phase 5 conversation since current screens fetch page=1 only.

## CI Status (legacy Phase 4)
- **Latest Phase 4 commit:** `4744e8d` (fix(phase-4): sanctions migration uses model.getTableName() (C18 hotfix))
- **CI/CD Pipeline (4744e8d):** green
- **Deploy (4744e8d):** green
- **C18 hotfix:** Customer.getTableName() returns 'Customer' (singular); migration UPDATE now uses model.getTableName() so the bug can't recur on a cold install.

---

## Phase 4 — In progress

Plan file: `C:\Users\Alex\.claude\plans\mutable-stargazing-bubble.md`

### C18 — Sanctions screening (SHIPPED, commit `9f33db7` + hotfix `4744e8d`, live)

**Schema:**
- `Customer` — added `screeningStatus` (enum), `lastScreenedAt`, `sanctionsScreenDetails` (JSON), `sanctionBlockReason`, `sanctionOverrideReason / At / By`, `registeredBuyerSince`, `registeredBuyer`. Indexes on `screening_status`, `last_screened_at`.
- `Lead` — added `screeningStatus`, `sanctionsScreenDetails`, `lastScreenedAt`. Legacy `sanctionsScreened` boolean kept for read compat.

**Migration `migrateSanctionsC18.js`:**
- Idempotent backfill setting `screening_status='pending'` on every NULL row. Sentinel: `phase4_sanctions_backfilled`. Wired into server.js after migrateConnectedAccounts.

**`backend/services/sanctionsService.js` (new):**
- `refreshSanctionsData()` — downloads OFAC SDN, OFAC Consolidated, EU Consolidated, UN SC Consolidated to `backend/data/sanctions/`. Atomic .tmp + rename writes. Manifest in `last_refresh.json`.
- `screenName(name, country)` — name normalization (strips Ltd/LLC/Inc/GmbH/Sdn/Bhd etc.), exact match + country-overlap gating, fuzzy via inline Levenshtein (ratio >= 0.85). Five statuses: pending / cleared / flagged / requires_review / override.
- mtime-cached in-memory parse so screen calls are sync after first load.
- Zero new package dependencies.

**Cron jobs (`schedulerService.js`):**
- `30 3 * * *` refreshSanctionsLists — toggle `SCHEDULER_SANCTIONS_REFRESH=false`.
- `0 4 * * *` rescreenCustomers90d — toggle `SCHEDULER_SANCTIONS_RESCREEN=false`.
- Both audit (`sanctions_refresh`, `sanctions_rescreen_batch`).

**API (`backend/modules/compliance/complianceRoutes.js`):**
- POST `/screen` — stateless screen of `{name, country}`.
- POST `/screen/:customerId` — re-screen + persist + audit `sanctions_screen`.
- POST `/customers/:id/override` — super-admin only, reason ≥ 10 chars, audits `sanctions_override`, sets `isActive=true`.
- GET `/sanctions/status` — last refresh manifest + file sizes + cron toggles.
- POST `/sanctions/refresh` — super-admin manual trigger.

**Four hard-block entry points:**
- `leadController.createLead` — synchronous screen; flagged → 403, NOT created, audit.
- `customerController.create` — synchronous screen; flagged → row created with `isActive=false`, 403 returned.
- `quotationController.create` — rejects on `customer.screeningStatus === 'flagged'`. override bypasses.
- `outreachController` per-lead + campaign — stale (>7d) re-screen on the fly; flagged blocks.
- All write `sanctions_block` with `context` field.

**Desktop:**
- New `SanctionsBadge.jsx` (5 variants).
- `CustomerDetail.jsx` — badge + red Override button (super-admin) + override modal (reason ≥ 10 chars, posts to `/compliance/customers/:id/override`).
- Block reason / override reason previewed under the customer title.

**Mobile:**
- `app/(tabs)/customers.tsx` — SANCTIONS / OVERRIDE / REVIEW inline chip on each customer row when status warrants.
- Customer interface in `src/services/api.ts` extended with sanctions fields.

**Three-surface docs:**
- tooltipContent — new keys: `sanctionsScreening`, `sanctionsCleared`, `sanctionsFlagged`, `sanctionsReview`, `sanctionsOverride`, `screeningSources`.
- helpContent — new `/compliance/sanctions` section.
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE — new "Sanctions screening (Phase 4, C18)" section.
- USER_GUIDE — new "Sanctions screening (Phase 4, C18)" section.

**`.gitignore`:**
- `backend/data/sanctions/*.csv` + `*.xml` + `last_refresh.json` (runtime caches; don't commit).

**AuditLog actions added:**
- `sanctions_screen`, `sanctions_block`, `sanctions_override`, `sanctions_refresh`, `sanctions_rescreen_batch`, `phase4_sanctions_backfilled`.

### C17 — Inbox / email UX brand awareness (SHIPPED, commit `ac4ff75`, live)

**Schema:**
- `ConnectedGoogleAccount.brandCode` STRING(8) NULL — FK Brand.code (constraints:false). Auto-added by autoMigrateSchema at boot.

**Migration `migrateConnectedAccounts.js` (idempotent, sentinel-guarded):**
- Backfills brandCode by matching account.email to Brand.senderEmail (LOWER comparison).
- Orphans (no matching brand) left NULL + logged.
- Sentinel: AuditLog action `phase4_connected_accounts_brand_backfilled`.
- Wired into server.js boot after backfillBrandsIfNeeded.

**OAuth enforcement (`googleAccountController.js`):**
- Callback now looks up Brand by senderEmail. New connects without a matching brand redirect to `?google=no_brand_match`.
- listAccounts + listAvailableAccounts include brandCode in returned attributes.

**Gmail sync (`gmailSyncService.js`):**
- processMessage accepts accountBrandCode. New TriageItem rows get brandCode = account.brandCode (fallback 'SH' for orphans).
- rawEmailData.fromAccount stores the polling email for forensics.

**Reply send (`triageController.js`):**
- Accepts triageItemId + fromAccountId in body.
- Resolves brand from triageItem.brandCode → req.brandScope.defaultBrand → 'SH'.
- Enforces fromAccount.brandCode === resolvedBrandCode: 400 + audit `brand_account_mismatch_block`.
- fromAddress = fromAccount.email || Brand.senderEmail || SMTP_FROM.
- Egypt BCC via `applyEgyptBccIfNeeded` (new helper in emailService.js).
- Audits every send as `reply_sent` with brand/from/to/subject/bccCount/country.

**Egypt BCC single source of truth (`emailService.js`):**
- New `applyEgyptBccIfNeeded(brandCode, country, bccList)` helper.
- outreachController.js outreach send + campaign send + triageController.js reply all call it. Three near-duplicate inline checks collapsed into one helper.

**Desktop (`frontend/admin-portal/src/pages/CRM/TriageInbox.jsx`):**
- BrandBadge on every triage card.
- ComposeModal: header brand chip; sender-account picker `/api/google/accounts` filtered by thread brand (mismatched accounts visible but disabled).
- Cross-brand banner for super-admin in `brandScope.isCrossBrand` mode (list endpoint already merges via `brandScope.where = {}`).
- Reply state passes triageItemId + threadBrandCode through to send-email.

**Mobile (`mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/(tabs)/triage.tsx`):**
- BrandBadge on every card (size sm, no label).
- New Reply button + modal with brand-locked sender picker (touchable list).
- `listConnectedGoogleAccounts` + `sendTriageReply` added to src/services/api.ts.
- TriageItem + ConnectedGoogleAccount types extended with brandCode.

**Three-surface docs:**
- tooltipContent — new keys: `inboxBrandBadge`, `replySenderPicker`, `crossBrandTriage`, `egyptBccRule`.
- helpContent — new `/crm/inbox` section: brand-aware threading, replying, Egypt BCC rule.
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE — new "Inbox / email UX brand awareness (Phase 4, C17)" section: schema, migration, OAuth enforcement, gmail sync propagation, reply enforcement, Egypt BCC helper, desktop, mobile, audit actions, risks.
- USER_GUIDE — new "Replying to inbox emails (Phase 4, C17)" section.

**AuditLog actions added:**
- `reply_sent`, `brand_account_mismatch_block`, `phase4_connected_accounts_brand_backfilled`.

### C16 — Quote-to-SalesOrder + brand-aware SO/PI/Invoice (SHIPPED, commit `1e9f417`, live)

**Backend:**
- `backend/utils/statusMachine.js` — SO transitions reconciled with SalesOrder model enum: draft → confirmed → in_production → ready → shipped → in_transit → delivered → completed; cancellable from any non-terminal state. `processing` removed (pre-flight verified zero rows on live DB).
- `backend/routes/salesOrderRoutes.js` — `POST /create-from-quotation` adds brand-access gate (403 if `req.brandScope.accessibleBrands` doesn't include the quotation's brand and not in cross-brand mode). `PATCH /:id/status` specialized audit `sales_order_status_change`.
- `backend/routes/proformaInvoiceRoutes.js` — `POST /:id/send` hard-blocks when `pi.brandCode === 'FW'` with 400 and audit `fw_send_blocked`. Defense-in-depth alongside the UI disable.
- `backend/routes/invoiceRoutes.js` — same FW send-block on `PATCH /:id/send`.

**PDF templates:**
- New `addFwInternalRecordBanner(doc, entity)` helper in `backend/services/pdf/pdfHelpers.js`. 28px iron-deep bar with cream "FACTORY WILL SEND TO BUYER — INTERNAL RECORD" text. No-op for non-FW.
- Wired into `generateSalesOrderPDF` (`orderDocumentsPDF.js`), `generateProformaInvoicePDF` (`salesDocumentsPDF.js`), `generateInvoicePDF` (`financeDocumentsPDF.js`) — banner injected after `doc.pipe(stream)`, before `getCompanyHeader`.

**Desktop:**
- `QuotationDetail.jsx` — fixed pre-existing `'approved'` bug (the Quotation enum is draft|sent|revised|accepted|rejected|expired). Added Convert-to-SO button visible when status='accepted' and brand-accessible. Modal with factory picker (defaults to quotation factory), estimatedDelivery, shippingMethod, notes. Routes to new SO on success. Modal includes FW internal-record note when brand='FW'.
- `ordersAPI.createFromQuotation()` added to `services/api.js`.
- `ProformaDetail.jsx` — `isFwInternalRecord` flag disables Send button (+ tooltip) and renders an iron-deep banner below the action bar.
- `OrderDetail.jsx` + `InvoiceDetail.jsx` — render the same iron-deep FW internal-record banner below the workflow status bar.

**Mobile:**
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/src/services/api.ts` — new `createSalesOrderFromQuotation` exported.
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/quotation/[id].tsx` — FW iron-deep banner above PDF buttons. New Convert-to-Sales-Order button visible when status='accepted' and brand-accessible. Alert-driven confirm flow; uses quotation.factoryId (errors if missing). For FW, the confirm prompt repeats the internal-record framing.

**Three-surface docs:**
- tooltipContent — new keys: `convertToSO`, `fwInternalRecord`, `salesOrderStatuses`.
- helpContent `/quotations` — new "Quotation lifecycle (Phase 4, C16)" section.
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE — new "Quote-to-SalesOrder + brand-aware SO/PI/Invoice (Phase 4, C16)" section: status machine reconciliation, convert flow, FW send-block defense in depth, PDF banner wiring, mobile parity, audit actions, pre-existing bug fixed.
- USER_GUIDE — new "Converting a Quotation to a Sales Order" + "FlorWay internal documents" sections under Common Workflows.

**AuditLog actions added:**
- `sales_order_status_change`, `fw_send_blocked`.

### C15 — FW commission ledger + dashboard + accrual rewrite (SHIPPED, commit `908d21d`, live)

**Schema:**
- `CommissionTracking` — added `customerId`, `brandCode` (default 'FW'), `accrualDate`, `registeredBuyerSince`. Status enum widened to add `accrued`, `invoiced_to_factory`, `clawed_back`. Default for new rows: `'accrued'`. Indexes on customer_id, brand_code, brand_code+status, accrual_date.
- `Brand` — added `commissionRate DECIMAL(5,4) DEFAULT 0.0500`. seedBrands: SH = 0.0000, FW = 0.0500.
- `Quotation` — added `commissionRateOverride DECIMAL(5,4) NULL` + index `(status, brand_code)` for forecast scan.

**Migration `migrateCommissionsC15.js` (idempotent, sentinel-guarded):**
- Status enum remap: `approved → accrued`, `cancelled → clawed_back`.
- Field backfill: customerId / brandCode / accrualDate via joined SO; orphans default brandCode='FW'.
- Brand.commissionRate backfill: SH=0.0000, FW=0.0500.
- Wired into server.js after seedProductsIfEmpty.

**Accrual rewrite `commissionAccrual.js`:**
- New `accrueIfConfirmed(db, so, userId)` — no-op unless SO is at 'confirmed'.
- Rate resolution: quotation.commissionRateOverride → brand.commissionRate → legacy CommissionRule fallback.
- Sets customerId, brandCode, accrualDate, registeredBuyerSince. Status 'accrued' for new rows.
- Backwards-compat alias `accrueCommissionForOrder` preserved.
- `updateCommissionPercentage` now enforces 5% floor (cannot override).
- Exports `COMMISSION_FLOOR_DECIMAL = 0.05`, `COMMISSION_FLOOR_PERCENT = 5.0`.

**salesOrderRoutes.js:**
- `PATCH /:id/status` now hooks accrueCommissionForOrder when status transitions from non-confirmed to 'confirmed'.

**quotationController.js:**
- create + update validate `commissionRateOverride >= 0.05` (decimal). Update path audits `commission_rate_override` when the field changes.

**New endpoints (`backend/routes/personalization/commissionRoutes.js`):**
- `GET /api/personalization/commissions/dashboard?brand=FW` — KPIs (MTD/QTD/YTD/PendingPayment) + pipeline forecast + deals + outstanding. Gated by inline `requireFwAccess` (super_admin OR accessibleBrands.includes('FW')).
- `POST /commissions/:id/mark-paid` — super_admin only, status=paid + paidDate. Audit `commission_paid`.
- `POST /commissions/:id/claw-back` — super_admin + reason (≥ 5 chars). Audit `commission_clawed_back`.

**Backend brandScope hook:** `personalizationRoutes.js` now applies `requireAuth + brandScope` at the router so commission endpoints can read `accessibleBrands`.

**Desktop:**
- New `frontend/admin-portal/src/pages/Analytics/CommissionDashboard.jsx` — KPI strip, pipeline forecast card, outstanding > 30d section (super-admin Mark-paid actions), full deals table with inline percentage editor (super-admin only on accrued/pending rows). Status pills color-coded.
- App.jsx: new lazy route `/commissions`.
- Layout.jsx: user-menu entry "FlorWay commission" visible only for super_admin OR `accessibleBrands.includes('FW')`.

**Mobile:**
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/src/components/CommissionWidget.tsx` rewired to use new `/dashboard` endpoint. Now tappable → navigates to `/commission` detail. Tiles show MTD Accrued + Pending payment.
- New `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/commission.tsx` — read-only deals list with KPIs, outstanding section, status pills. Mobile-friendly card layout.

**Three-surface docs:**
- tooltipContent — new keys: `commissionRateOverride`, `commissionFloor`, `commissionStatuses`, `markPaid`, `clawBack`, `pipelineForecast`, `outstandingTracker`.
- helpContent — new "FlorWay commission tracking (Phase 4)" section under `/`.
- DEVELOPER_GUIDE — new "FlorWay commission tracking (Phase 4, C15)" section: schema deltas, migration, rate resolution, accrual trigger points, floor enforcement, API endpoints, percentage-vs-decimal note, UI, AuditLog actions, pipeline forecast notes.
- USER_GUIDE — new "Tracking FlorWay Commission (Phase 4)" walkthrough.

**AuditLog actions added:**
- `commission_rate_override`, `commission_paid`, `commission_clawed_back`, `phase4_commission_status_migrated`, `phase4_commission_fields_backfilled`, `phase4_brand_commission_rate_backfilled`.

### C14 — Brand-aware product catalog (SHIPPED, commit `8fb9a6a`, live)

**Backend:**
- `backend/models/Product.js` — added 8 fields: brandCode (default 'SH'), productType (enum), baseFobPrice (decimal FLOOR), currency, moqUnit, leadTimeDays, certifications (JSON), originCountry. Compound + brand_code indexes added; SKU stays globally unique (column-level UNIQUE can't ALTER on SQLite; deviation documented).
- `backend/models/index.js` + `backend/services/migrateBrands.js` — 'Product' added to BRAND_TX_MODELS + TX_MODELS so existing 31 rows backfill to brandCode='SH'.
- `backend/routes/productRoutes.js` — router-level `requireAuth + brandScope`. Every product request is brand-scoped.
- `backend/controllers/productController.js` — create accepts new fields, defaults brandCode from req.brandScope.defaultBrand, calls assertBrandWritable. getAll applies brandWhere(req) + productType filter. getById + update both 404 on wrong brand (no existence leak).
- `backend/controllers/quotationController.js` line 36-54 — line-item loop now enforces (a) brand match between product and quotation, (b) floor check (unitPrice >= product.baseFobPrice); below-floor requires super-admin role + belowFloorReason (>= 5 chars) per item, audited as `product_floor_override`. Defaults unitPrice from baseFobPrice when absent. Explicit no-markup invariant comment.
- New `backend/services/seedProducts.js` — idempotent on (brandCode, sku). 3 FW placeholders (FW-SPC-65 IronLite 6.5mm $5.80, FW-SPC-85 IronLite 8.5mm $7.20, FW-WPC-65 Generic WPC 6.5mm $6.40), 2 SH placeholders (SH-HW-14 Engineered Oak 14mm $24.00, SH-LAM-8 Laminate 8mm AC4 $6.80). PLACEHOLDER prices commented for replacement. Wired into server.js boot after seedCommissionRulesIfEmpty.

**Desktop:**
- New `frontend/admin-portal/src/pages/Settings/ProductCatalog.jsx` — admin page at /settings/products. Brand filter (BrandFilterPicker), DataTable with SKU/Name/Brand/Type/floor price/MOQ/Lead/Active columns, New/Edit modal with BrandPicker (locked on edit), deactivate toggle. Floor price column reads baseFobPrice.
- `App.jsx` lazy route + `Layout.jsx` user-menu link "Product catalog".
- `QuotationForm.jsx` — line-item Product dropdown is brand-filtered via re-fetch on brandCode change. Picking a product autofills unitPrice from baseFobPrice and unit from moqUnit. Below-floor reveals an amber warning + reason input; reason submitted as `belowFloorReason` per item.

**Mobile:**
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/(tabs)/products.tsx` — BrandFilterPicker at top, BrandBadge on each row. baseFobPrice preferred over legacy ProductPrice.sellingPrice on display.
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/src/services/api.ts` — Product type extended with new fields. getProducts accepts brandCode + status params.

**Three-surface docs:**
- `tooltipContent.js` PRODUCT — new entries: brandCode, productType, baseFobPrice, moqUnit, leadTimeDays, certifications, originCountry, floorOverride.
- `helpContent.js` `/products` — new "Brand-aware catalog (Phase 4)" section.
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` — new "Product catalog (Phase 4, C14)" section: schema delta, quotation flow integration, frontend, mobile, seed, AuditLog actions, no-markup invariant + grep blocklist.
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` — new "Managing the Product Catalog (Phase 4)" walkthrough.

**AuditLog action:**
- `product_floor_override` — entity Product, changes {sku, floor, quotedPrice, reason}.

**Plan deviation: SKU globally unique (not per-brand).** SQLite ALTER limitations + 31 live rows + many FK relations make the table rebuild unsafe for this commit. Brand-prefixed seed SKUs (FW-*/SH-*) sidestep collisions. Phase 5 ticket: rationalize Product+ProductPrice and do the per-brand SKU rebuild.

**Pre-existing bug fixed in-flight:** productController.create didn't call assertBrandWritable. Now it does.

7 commits, all CI green, all deployed live on `erp.sovernhouse.co`.

---

## What Alex still owes manually (next time he's at his Windows machine)

1. **Mobile npm install** — `cd "C:\Users\Alex\Desktop\International Trade Company\Trading ERP\mobile\sovern-ops-app"` then `npm install`. Picks up `expo-file-system` + `expo-sharing` added in C9 for the mobile Preview/Download PDF feature. Without this, the mobile PDF buttons throw on tap.

2. **Optional: typography upgrade for PDFs** — drop these into `backend/assets/fonts/` to swap Helvetica fallback for the FW brand-spec fonts:
   - `Anton-Regular.ttf` (display)
   - `Inter-Regular.ttf` + `Inter-Bold.ttf` (body)
   - All free from fonts.google.com (OFL). The PDF renderer's `registerBrandFonts` already conditionally registers them; no code change needed when they appear.

3. **Optional: flex the FW commission rate** — set `FW_COMMISSION_RATE=<n>` (e.g. `7`) in the GCP VM's env and restart pm2 to seed a different default. Existing CommissionTracking rows keep their per-order rates.

4. **Auto-update error on the Claude Code CLI** — separate from the ERP. Run `! claude doctor` from this prompt to diagnose, then `npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` in an elevated PowerShell if needed.

---

## Smoke-test checklist Alex hasn't run yet (Phase 3 verification)

When you next have a phone in hand + a test customer in the DB, walk through:

**FW PDF variants (after `npm install`):**
1. FW customer with `productBrandingMode='ironlite'` + WPC quotation → Download PDF → I-Beam wordmark, OEM badge, construction diagram on page 2.
2. Same customer with `productBrandingMode='generic'` → FlorWay Sdn Bhd wordmark, no IronLite imagery.
3. Same customer with `productBrandingMode='private_label'` + a brand name → placeholder page with TODO banner.
4. SH customer + quotation → new SH brand-styled layout (forest/cream/ink). This is a visual change from the old pdfkit-classic layout for SH; flag if it doesn't match your taste.
5. Send FW quotation by email → PDF attached, sender `alexflorway@gmail.com`, no Mohanad BCC.
6. Footer middot (U+00B7) renders, no em dashes anywhere.
7. Mobile: open quotation detail → tap Preview PDF (opens in viewer) → tap Download PDF (share sheet).

**Brand-scoped reporting:**
8. Dashboard top-right brand picker → toggle SH / FW → KPIs and charts update.
9. FW commission widget renders three tiles (Accrued / Paid / Pending) for the current Taipei month.
10. Click "Show orders" → expand the per-order list → change a pending row's percentage → confirm the amount recalculates and saves.
11. As super-admin in cross-brand view → see the BrandRevenueComparison side-by-side bar.

**productBrandingMode lock:**
12. Add FW to a customer's brand relationships → picker appears on customer detail.
13. Set mode to `ironlite`, send an FW quotation → reload customer detail → picker locked with Asia/Taipei lock timestamp.
14. As super-admin → click Override → enter reason (min 3 chars) → confirm. Audit log entry should appear.

**Phase 1 polish:**
15. Create an FW lead/quote/deal against an existing SH-only customer → toast appears, customer brand relationships now include FW.
16. As an SH-only user, hit `/api/quotations/<FW-id>` directly → 404 (not 403).
17. BrandBadge visible on Order, Invoice, ProformaInvoice detail headers.
18. BrandPicker visible on LeadForm, QuotationForm, DealForm.

**Timezone:**
19. Every date and time on every screen, every PDF footer, every audit log timestamp → Taipei time.

---

## Deferred (not in Phase 3 — pick up in a future phase)

- **SO / PO / Invoice / Packing List brand-aware document templates** — factory currently sends FW docs per your standing decision. Pick up when factory hands off.
- **Full Private Label quotation template** — placeholder ships now; full template lands when the first OEM private-label buyer signs.
- **Calendar / Docs MCP integration extensions** — not blocking.
- **Quotation approval workflow** — Mr. Lee / Alice confirmed no sign-off needed.

---

## Stale memory note

`project_expenses_per_brand` memory says Phase 1 didn't tag Expense/Office/Trip/Submission with brandCode and that we owe a sub-commit. The Phase 3 Explore agent confirmed they ARE tagged from Phase 1 Commit 3b-A. Memory should be updated/deleted when convenient.

---

## Next session pickup

If you come back to ERP work, start by:

1. `git log --oneline -8` to confirm we're at `e65f664` on `main` (or further if anyone pushed).
2. Re-read this file and `lessons.md` per the standing protocol.
3. Either:
   - Smoke-test the checklist above and report findings, OR
   - Pick up one of the deferred items above, OR
   - Hit a new feature ask.

---

### Mobile L-042 follow-up (SHIPPED, commit `e65f664`, live)

Every per-screen mobile date formatter now passes `timeZone: 'Asia/Taipei'`. 14 files touched, ~28 call sites updated.

**Files:**
- `app/quotation/[id].tsx` (4 sites)
- `app/lead/[id].tsx` (1)
- `src/components/ChatterSection.tsx` (1)
- `app/dev-runs.tsx` (2)
- `app/(tabs)/assistant.tsx` (1 date formatter; currency `toLocaleString` calls left alone)
- `app/(tabs)/approvals.tsx` (3)
- `app/(tabs)/activities.tsx` (1)
- `app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx` (1)
- `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` (3)
- `app/(tabs)/inquiries.tsx` (1 date; currency left alone)
- `app/(tabs)/invoices.tsx` (1 date)
- `app/(tabs)/purchase-orders.tsx` (4 incl. share-link expiry)
- `app/(tabs)/research.tsx` (1)
- `app/(tabs)/sales-orders.tsx` (4 incl. share-link expiry)
- `app/(tabs)/triage.tsx` (2)
- `app/(tabs)/shipments.tsx` (1)

Currency `Number.toLocaleString` calls intentionally left as-is — they're number formatting, not date formatting, and don't need a timezone.

L-042 desktop migration (in commit `ddf80a1`) plus this mobile migration close the timezone loop for every user-facing surface in the ERP.

### Phase 3 mechanical follow-ups (SHIPPED, commit `ddf80a1`, live)

**404-on-wrong-brand extended:**
- `inquiryController.getById` — `isAccessibleByBrandCode` check after the findByPk.
- `activityController.getActivityById` — same.
- `triageController.getTriageItem` — same.
- `documentRoutes` GET `/:id` — same.
- OutreachEmail has no standalone get-by-id endpoint (only nested under leads) — nothing to lock down.

**Analytics brand-scoped:**
- `analyticsRoutes` — `order-funnel`, `top-products`, `customer-segments`, `factory-performance`, `payment-aging`, `shipment-timeline`, `profit-margins`, `forecast` all now use `brandWhere(req)` or `brandWhereSql(req, alias)`. Per-route `requireAuth` removed (router-level applies it).
- `shipment-timeline` joins to SalesOrder for brand-scoping (Shipment carries no brandCode directly).
- `factory-performance` brand-scopes PurchaseOrder side; Factory itself is shared across brands.
- `customer-segments` brand-scopes the SalesOrder join; customers with zero matching orders still appear with revenue=0 (Customer's JSON `brandRelationships` requires app-layer filtering, separate concern).

**L-042 desktop formatters:**
- `frontend/admin-portal/src/utils/formatters.js` — `formatDate` and `formatDateTime` now use `Intl.DateTimeFormat` with `timeZone: 'Asia/Taipei'`. Every existing call site auto-upgrades.
- Mobile screens use per-screen inline `toLocaleDateString` without timeZone — out of scope here; mark as future cleanup.

**SH PDF path confirmation:**
- No code change. `renderSovernHouseClassic` writes to `uploads/quotations/SH/classic/` since C10 (verified at `brandedQuotationRenderer.js:91`). The follow-up note in C13 was stale.

---

### C13 — Phase 1 polish bundle (SHIPPED, commit `14cd45b`, live)

**BrandBadge expansion (desktop detail headers):**
- `OrderDetail.jsx`, `InvoiceDetail.jsx`, `ProformaDetail.jsx` — added `<BrandBadge code={record.brandCode || 'SH'} size="sm" />` next to the StatusBadge.
- Customer, Lead, Quotation already had it from earlier phases.
- PurchaseOrder and Inquiry detail pages are stubs without real headers — deferred.

**BrandPicker on create forms:**
- New `frontend/admin-portal/src/components/BrandPicker.jsx` (from Phase 1) wired into:
  - `LeadForm.jsx` — picker above company info, brandCode in form state, disabled in edit mode.
  - `QuotationForm.jsx` — picker above customer section, brandCode in submitData payload.
  - `DealForm.jsx` — picker above deal information, brandCode in spread submitData.

**Cross-brand auto-add:**
- New `backend/services/crossBrandAutoAdd.js` — `addBrandIfMissing(db, customerId, brandCode, triggeredBy)` extends `customer.brandRelationships` dedup-safe and writes `cross_brand_relationship_added` AuditLog row. Fire-and-forget at call sites.
- Wired into `leadController.createLead`, `quotationController.create`, `dealController.createDeal`. All three now return `autoAddedBrand` in the response.
- Frontend create forms (LeadForm, QuotationForm, DealForm) show a toast / success banner when `autoAddedBrand` is present.

**404-on-wrong-brand:**
- New `backend/utils/notFoundOnWrongBrand.js` — `isAccessibleByBrandCode(req, brandCode)` and `isAccessibleByBrandRelationships(req, rels)` helpers.
- Applied to getById on: Quotation, Customer (brandRelationships pattern), Deal, SalesOrder, Invoice, ProformaInvoice.
- Remaining (Activity, OutreachEmail, TriageItem, Document, Inquiry) follow the same pattern — mechanical follow-up. Writes stay 403 via `assertBrandWritable`.

**brandCode propagation on quotation create:**
- `quotationController.create` now reads `brandCode` from body, falls back to `req.brandScope.defaultBrand` then `'SH'`, and persists it on the new Quotation. (Phase 1 model had brandCode but the create route wasn't passing it.)

**Audit log action:**
- New action `cross_brand_relationship_added` — entity=Customer, changes={oldBrands, newBrands, addedBrand, triggeredByEntity, triggeredByEntityId}.

**Three-surface docs:**
- `tooltipContent.js` — `BRAND.crossBrandAutoAdd`, `BRAND.brandPickerOnCreate`.
- `helpContent.js` — new "Cross-brand auto-add (Phase 3, C13)" section under `/customers`.
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` — new "Cross-brand auto-add + 404-on-wrong-brand (Phase 3, C13)" section with helper docs, endpoint coverage table, BrandPicker wiring notes.
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` — new "Cross-Brand Auto-Add (Phase 3)" subsection under Managing Customers.

---

### C12 — productBrandingMode picker UI + lock + super-admin override (SHIPPED, commit `e9c0938`, live)

**Schema:**
- `backend/models/Customer.js` — adds `productBrandingModeLockedAt` (DATE, nullable, default null). Auto-migrates on boot via alter-sync.

**Backend:**
- `customerController.update()` accepts `productBrandingMode` and `privateLabelProductName`. Rejects non-super_admin edits when locked. Validates `private_label` requires non-empty `privateLabelProductName`.
- New `customerController.overrideProductBrandingModeLock` + route `POST /api/customers/:id/override-branding-mode-lock` (super_admin only via bare-string requireRole per L-031). Body `{ newMode, newPrivateLabelProductName?, reason }`. Reason min 3 chars. Clears lock, writes `product_branding_mode_override` AuditLog row.
- `quotationController.send` — after status flip to 'sent', if `brandCode==='FW'` and the customer has a mode set and isn't already locked, sets `productBrandingModeLockedAt = new Date()` and writes `product_branding_mode_locked` AuditLog row. Idempotent.

**Desktop:**
- New `frontend/admin-portal/src/components/ProductBrandingModePicker.jsx` — three radio cards (IronLite / Generic / Private Label), required private-label name input, lock badge with Asia/Taipei timestamp, super-admin "Override lock" dialog (mode + name + reason).
- `frontend/admin-portal/src/pages/Customers/CustomerDetail.jsx` — renders the picker only when `customer.brandRelationships.includes('FW')`. Uses `useAuth()` for super_admin gating.

**Mobile:**
- New `mobile/sovern-ops-app/src/components/ProductBrandingModePicker.tsx` — pill toggle, private-label inline input, lock badge. Override stays desktop-only.
- `app/(tabs)/customers.tsx` — renders the picker inside the customer detail modal when FW is in brand relationships.
- `src/services/api.ts` Customer type — adds `productBrandingModeLockedAt`.

**Audit log:**
- New action `product_branding_mode_locked` — entity=Customer, changes={mode, lockedAt, triggeredBy:{entity:'Quotation', id, quotationNumber}}.
- New action `product_branding_mode_override` — entity=Customer, changes={oldMode, newMode, oldPrivateLabelProductName, newPrivateLabelProductName, oldLockedAt, newLockedAt:null, reason}.

**Three-surface docs:**
- `tooltipContent.js` — extends `CUSTOMER.productBrandingMode` with lock note, new `CUSTOMER.productBrandingModeLocked`.
- `helpContent.js` — new "FlorWay product branding mode (Phase 3)" section under `/customers`.
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` — new "Customer.productBrandingMode lock semantics (Phase 3, C12)" section with schema, trigger, enforcement, override flow, audit actions.
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` — new "FlorWay Product Branding Mode" subsection under Managing Customers.

### C11 — Per-brand reporting + FW commission widget (SHIPPED, commit `72c7844`, live)

**Backend:**
- New `backend/services/seedCommissionRules.js` — idempotently inserts `FW Sales Commission` rule (ruleType=percentage, baseValue=5, applicableRoles=['sales','super_admin']). Wired into `server.js` after the brand seed. Reads `FW_COMMISSION_RATE` env if you want to flex the default without a code change.
- New `backend/services/commissionAccrual.js` — `accrueCommissionForOrder(db, so, userId)` fire-and-forget helper. Idempotent per (userId, salesOrderId). Looks up the rule by `${brand.displayName} Sales Commission`. Also exports `updateCommissionPercentage(row, newPct)` used by the PATCH endpoint.
- `backend/routes/salesOrderRoutes.js` — both SO create paths now (a) propagate `brandCode` (body wins, else user defaultBrand, else 'SH'; the create-from-quotation path inherits from the source quotation) and (b) call `accrueCommissionForOrder` post-creation.
- `backend/routes/personalization/commissionRoutes.js` — three new endpoints:
  - `GET /commissions/summary?brandCode=FW&period=mtd` — Accrued / Paid / Pending tiles + contributing rows. Used by CommissionWidget.
  - `PATCH /commissions/:id` — per-order percentage edit. Super_admin any; owner only on pending rows.
  - `GET /commissions/brand-comparison` — super_admin only; SH vs FW revenue + commission for MTD. Used by BrandRevenueComparison widget.
- New `backend/utils/brandFilterUtils.js` — `brandWhere(req)`, `brandWhereSql(req, alias)`, `filterCustomersByBrand(rows, req)`. Layered on top of `brandScope` middleware to give a clean `?brandCode=` override.
- `backend/routes/dashboardRoutes.js` — `router.use(requireAuth, brandScope)` + brand-scoped admin dashboard + mobile summary.
- `backend/routes/analyticsRoutes.js` — `router.use(requireAuth, brandScope)` + revenue-trend brand-scoped via raw-SQL helper.
- `backend/routes/reportRoutes.js` — `router.use(requireAuth, brandScope)` + sales report brand-scoped.

**Desktop:**
- New `frontend/admin-portal/src/components/BrandFilterPicker.jsx` — top-of-page pill; hidden for single-brand users; persists choice to localStorage; "All Brands" option for super_admin in cross-brand mode.
- New `frontend/admin-portal/src/components/DashboardWidgets/CommissionWidget.jsx` — FW MTD tiles + expandable per-order table with inline percentage edit.
- New `frontend/admin-portal/src/components/DashboardWidgets/BrandRevenueComparison.jsx` — super_admin cross-brand only; Recharts grouped bar.
- `Dashboard.jsx` — BrandFilterPicker in header + both widgets above KPI row; `brandFilter` state passed as `?brandCode=` to all dashboard API calls.
- `services/api.js` dashboardAPI — every endpoint now accepts `{ brandCode }` params.
- `utils/formatters.js` — new `formatDateTaipei` + `formatDateTimeTaipei` (L-042 compliance for Phase 3 strings; legacy formatters unchanged).

**Mobile:**
- New `mobile/sovern-ops-app/src/components/BrandFilterPicker.tsx` — pill toggle, mirrors desktop logic.
- New `mobile/sovern-ops-app/src/components/CommissionWidget.tsx` — read-only summary (per-order edit stays desktop-only).
- `app/(tabs)/dashboard.tsx` — wires both above the pipeline metrics; `brandFilter` state passed to `getDashboard({brandCode})`.
- `src/services/api.ts` `getDashboard` — now accepts optional `{brandCode}`.

**Three-surface docs:**
- `tooltipContent.js` — `DASHBOARD.brandFilter`, `allBrands`, `fwCommission`, `brandRevenueComparison`.
- `helpContent.js` — new "Brand-filtered reporting (Phase 3)" section under `/`.
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` — new "Brand-Scoped Dashboards + FW Commission (Phase 3, C11)" section with wiring pattern, files of interest, FW commission accrual flow, endpoints, L-042 note.
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` — new "Brand Filter on Dashboards" + "FlorWay Commission Widget" paragraphs.

**Scope notes:**
- Brand-scope helper applied to the most-visible queries (admin dashboard, mobile summary, revenue-trend, sales report). Remaining analytics endpoints (order-funnel, top-products, customer-segments, factory-performance, payment-aging, profit-margins, forecast) inherit `req.brandScope` from middleware but the where-clause weaving on each handler is a mechanical follow-up — not blocking C11.
- Customer queries (JSON `brandRelationships`) require application-layer filtering via `filterCustomersByBrand`; the admin dashboard accepts a small under-scope until that follow-up.

### C10 — SH brand-styled quotation renderer (SHIPPED, commit `7e8a8f5`, live)

**What ships:**
- Replaced the C9 SH classic delegate with a native `renderSovernHouseClassic()` in `backend/services/pdf/brandedQuotationRenderer.js`. Same shared draw helpers as FW (brand-agnostic — they take a tokens bag) so the SH document has the same structural rigor as FW but with the Sovern House palette: forest #1D5A32 primary, cream #F1EEE7 accent, ink body text, with a clay/bronze accent reserved.
- SH wordmark header reads the `sovern-house-logo-light.png` asset; falls back to text "SOVERN HOUSE / INTERNATIONAL TRADE" when the asset is missing.
- Footer middot legal "New Route International Exchange Co., Ltd. · Taiwan".
- Sender block "Alexander McConnell / FOUNDER / alex@sovernhouse.co".
- Trading-house intro paragraph ("verified factories across Asia, ships under your preferred Incoterm").
- Output path moved from `uploads/quotations/quotation-{number}.pdf` to `uploads/quotations/SH/classic/quotation-{number}-{timestamp}.pdf` for consistency with the FW brand+variant convention.
- 3 SH logo PNGs copied into `frontend/admin-portal/public/brand-assets/sovern-house/` for consistency with the florway/ folder layout. The originals at `/public/` root are untouched.
- `legacySales` import removed from `brandedQuotationRenderer.js` (no longer used). `salesDocumentsPDF.js` retained for `generateProformaInvoicePDF` + `generateSalesNotePDF` which other phases will replace.
- Doc wording generalized: tooltips + helpContent + DEVELOPER_GUIDE no longer say "SH falls through to legacy"; they now describe SH as brand-styled.

**Visual regression accepted:** every existing SH quotation now re-renders with the new layout when re-downloaded. No data change.

### C9 — FW quotation document template (SHIPPED, commit `cbb308a`, live)

**What ships:**
- New `backend/services/pdf/brandedQuotationRenderer.js` — dispatch + 3 FW variants + SH classic delegate. Selects variant from `Customer.productBrandingMode` automatically.
- New `backend/services/pdf/brandStyleTokens.js` — FW iron-deep/cream palette, footer middot legal line, sender block, asset paths, conditional Anton/Inter font registration with Helvetica fallback.
- `backend/services/documentGenerator.js` — barrel override so `generateQuotationPDF` routes through dispatch.
- `backend/controllers/quotationController.js` — `send()` passes brand into PDF; `generatePDF()` fetches brand and now **streams binary** as `Content-Type: application/pdf` (fixes pre-existing bug where the frontend expected blob but backend returned JSON, producing corrupted downloads).
- `frontend/admin-portal/src/pages/Quotations/QuotationDetail.jsx` — variant hint banner for FW (IronLite / Generic / Private Label) and private-label "in development" notice.
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/quotation/[id].tsx` — Preview PDF + Download PDF buttons, variant banner. Send via ERP button preserved.
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/src/services/api.ts` — new `downloadQuotationPDF(id, {inline})` helper using lazy-loaded `expo-file-system`.
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/package.json` — added `expo-file-system ~19.0.16` and `expo-sharing ~14.0.7`.
- 6 IronLite PNGs copied into `frontend/admin-portal/public/brand-assets/florway/` (versioned, deployable).
- `tooltipContent.js` — new `QUOTATION.documentPreview` + `QUOTATION.florWayVariants`.
- `helpContent.js` — new "Brand-aware quotation document" section under `/quotations`.
- `DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` — new "Brand-Aware Quotation Documents (Phase 3, C9 / C10)" section with pipeline diagram, file index, variant selector code, asset path resolution, font registration, "Adding a new brand" recipe.
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` — new "Brand-Aware Quotation Documents" + "Downloading and Previewing the PDF" subsections under Managing Quotations.

**Manual steps before testing:**
1. `cd mobile/sovern-ops-app && npm install` (picks up expo-file-system + expo-sharing). Alex runs this on Windows.
2. (Optional) Drop `Anton-Regular.ttf` + `Inter-Regular.ttf` + `Inter-Bold.ttf` from fonts.google.com into `backend/assets/fonts/`. PDFs render fine without them (Helvetica fallback) — typography auto-upgrades when present.
3. Restart backend on GCP VM after deploy so the new renderer is loaded.

**Verification checklist (after commit + deploy):**
1. FW customer with `productBrandingMode='ironlite'` + WPC quotation → Download PDF → I-Beam wordmark header, OEM badge, construction diagram on page 2.
2. Same customer with mode `generic` → FlorWay Sdn Bhd wordmark, no IronLite imagery.
3. Same customer with mode `private_label` + `privateLabelProductName='OakCove Flooring'` → placeholder page with TODO banner.
4. SH quotation → existing pdfkit-classic layout (regression check; C10 replaces).
5. FW quotation `send` → email with PDF preview; sender `alexflorway@gmail.com`; no Mohanad BCC.
6. Footer middot (U+00B7) renders.
7. No em dashes anywhere.
8. Mobile Preview PDF + Download PDF buttons work after `npm install`.

### Remaining Phase 3 work (post-C9 commit)
- C10 — SH quotation template (replaces legacy SH pdfkit-classic with brand-styled SH layout).
- C11 — Per-brand reporting dashboards + FW commission widget.
- C12 — `productBrandingMode` picker UI on Customer detail + lock-after-sent + super-admin override.
- C13 — Phase 1 polish bundle (BrandBadge expansion, BrandPicker on create forms, cross-brand auto-add, 404-on-wrong-brand getById extension).

## Where We Are

### Phase 2 — Multi-Brand (SH + FlorWay) — COMPLETE ✅

All Phase 2 work is shipped. The ERP is now fully brand-aware for the SH and FW brands across every key surface.

#### What Phase 2 delivered (this session + the session that led into this one)

**C5 — Brand-aware email composer (carried from prior session, commit `e53e4c2`):**
- Outreach emails auto-select `fromAddress` and signature from `lead.brandCode → Brand.senderEmail`
- `From` header uses `brand.displayName | Alex` (e.g. "FlorWay | Alex" not hardcoded SH)
- Campaign send validation checks against live `Brand.senderEmail` values (enables `alexflorway@gmail.com`)
- Egypt BCC rule (`mohanadfanzey@gmail.com`) gated to `brandCode === 'SH'` only, never FW
- FW brand has its own `signatureHtml` and `signatureText` (iron-deep divider, generic FlorWay copy, FLORWAY SDN. BHD. footer)
- `Brand.signatureText` column added to model + auto-migrated on boot

**C6 — Brand-aware quotation email sender (commit `caca318`):**
- `emailService.js`: new `sendTransactionalEmail` (Gmail API, pre-built HTML/text) + `sendTransactionalEmailWithFallback` (SMTP fallback). Same connected-account lookup as outreach.
- `quotationController.js`: `send()` now looks up `quotation.brandCode → Brand`, builds brand-colored HTML email with line items table + totals + signature, routes via `sendTransactionalEmailWithFallback`. Replaces generic SMTP `sendQuotationEmail`.
- `QuotationDetail.jsx`: `BrandBadge` in header, Send dialog shows brand sender email.
- `api.ts` (mobile): `brandCode` on `Quotation` interface, `sendQuotation(id)` function.
- `quotation/[id].tsx` (mobile): `BrandBadge` in header, "Send via ERP" button (draft-only) with brand-aware confirmation prompt.

**C7 — Brand admin UI (commit `319189a`):**
- `GET /api/brands/:code` + `PUT /api/brands/:code` (super_admin only) — update displayName, senderEmail, primaryColor, accentColor, logoUrl, signatureHtml, signatureText, footerLegalText
- `Settings/BrandAdmin.jsx` (new): accordion card per brand, color pickers with hex inputs, textareas for HTML/plain-text signatures and footer legal, dirty-state guard, discard button
- Route `/settings/brands` (super_admin only); "Brands" link added to user dropdown menu
- `app/brands.tsx` (mobile, new): read-only brand info screen — colors, sender email, footer legal
- Settings screen: "Brands" row in System section → navigates to `/brands`

**C8 — FW email templates + brand-filtered picker (commit `553b303`):**
- `EmailTemplate` model: `brandCode STRING(8)` nullable, auto-migrated on boot
- `emailTemplateController`: GET accepts `?brandCode=` filter; POST/PUT accept + persist brandCode
- `seedEmailTemplates.js` (new): on boot, backfills existing templates to `brandCode='SH'`, then creates 6 FW templates idempotently:
  - FlorWay - US Flooring Importers (Touch 1) — Section 301 / ASEAN angle
  - FlorWay - EU Flooring Importers (Touch 1) — antidumping / CE angle
  - FlorWay - UK Flooring Importers (Touch 1) — UKCA angle
  - FlorWay - Australia / NZ Flooring Importers (Touch 1) — short ANZ lead time angle
  - FlorWay - LATAM Flooring Importers (Touch 1) — Spanish/Portuguese offer
  - FlorWay - Middle East Flooring Importers (Touch 1) — CIF Gulf / hospitality angle
- `ComposePanel` in ClientContacts.jsx: loads `?brandCode=${leadBrandCode}` — FW lead sees FW templates only
- `BulkSendModal`: template fetch is reactive to `form.fromAddress`; switches brand → template list refreshes
- Both panels tag any saved templates with the current brandCode

## How the Multi-Brand System Works (reference)

| Layer | Where it lives | How it works |
|---|---|---|
| Brand table | `backend/models/Brand.js` | SH + FW rows. `code`, `senderEmail`, `displayName`, `primaryColor`, `accentColor`, `signatureHtml`, `signatureText`, `footerLegalText`, `logoUrl` |
| Brand seeding | `backend/services/seedBrands.js` | Idempotent on boot. FW has its own signature HTML/text. SH signature is `null` (served by EmailSignature flow) |
| Brand scope middleware | `backend/middleware/brandScope.js` | Injects `req.brandScope.where` for list filtering. Super_admin sees all. |
| brandCode FK | All transactional models (Lead, Quotation, Deal, etc.) | `STRING(8)`, FK to Brand.code, auto-migrated on boot, backfilled to 'SH' |
| BrandsContext (desktop) | `frontend/admin-portal/src/contexts/BrandsContext.jsx` | `useBrands()` hook: `getBrand(code)`, `accessibleBrands`, `defaultBrand` |
| useBrands (mobile) | `mobile/sovern-ops-app/src/hooks/useBrands.ts` | Module-level cache, same API surface |
| BrandBadge | Both surfaces | Color-coded pill: green = SH, blue = FW |
| Email composer | `ClientContacts.jsx` ComposePanel + BulkSendModal | Auto-selects fromAddress from brand; filters templates by brandCode |
| Campaign validation | `outreachController.js` sendCampaign | Validates fromAddress against live `Brand.senderEmail` values (not static domain list) |
| Quotation email | `quotationController.js` send | Looks up brand, builds brand-colored HTML email, routes via Gmail API |
| Egypt BCC | `outreachController.js` | `brandCode === 'SH' && country === 'Egypt'` only — never FW |
| Brand admin UI | `/settings/brands` (desktop) | Super_admin only. Edit all brand fields via accordion. |
| Brand view (mobile) | `app/brands.tsx` | Read-only. Linked from Settings > System > Brands |
| Template filtering | `emailTemplateController` + composer | `?brandCode=X` returns brand-specific templates; seed backfills existing to SH, creates FW on boot |

## Phase 1 Deferred Polish (still outstanding)

These were explicitly deferred during Phase 1 and not addressed in Phase 2:

- **BrandPicker in create forms** — LeadForm, QuotationForm, DealForm. Users can brand-override an existing entity via `/admin/brand-override` (audit-logged) but the create form doesn't have a picker yet. Low urgency while super_admin creates all new entities.
- **BrandBadge on deal/SO/PO/invoice headers** — added to Lead, Lead list, Quotation. Still missing from Deal, SalesOrder, PurchaseOrder, Invoice, ProformaInvoice detail pages.
- **404-on-wrong-brand for get-by-id** — implemented for Lead detail. Not yet on Quotation, Deal, SO, PO, Invoice endpoints (they return the record regardless of brand scope mismatch).
- **Mobile EAS native rebuild** — Blocked on Apple Developer account. Items 2 (voice) + 3 (camera/doc picker) from the prior AI UX session still need a native rebuild to ship on mobile. Until then those buttons throw on tap.

---

## Outstanding From Previous Sessions

### Scan-Receipt flow (staged, never committed)
The SESSION.md before this session noted these files were staged but not committed:
- `backend/routes/aiRoutes.js`
- `frontend/admin-portal/src/pages/Expenses/ExpensesPage.jsx`
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/src/services/api.ts`
- `mobile/sovern-ops-app/app/(tabs)/expenses.tsx`

**Check the working tree first thing next session.** Run `git status` and `git diff --staged`. If the staged changes are still there, test the flow (real receipt photo on desktop, confirm Drive upload + AI extract + pre-fill banner) then commit + push.

### VM kernel update pending
`*** System restart required ***` on VM login. Schedule a reboot when convenient. pm2 handles restart cleanly.

---

## Next Task

**Start of next session — in order:**

1. `git status` — check if the scan-receipt staged changes are still there. If yes, test + commit.
2. Pick a Phase 1 polish item from the list above, or start the next major feature.

**Likely next major feature candidates (Alex to confirm direction):**
- **BrandPicker in create forms** — LeadForm, QuotationForm, DealForm. Straightforward UI addition.
- **Customer profitability page UI** — backend endpoint (`GET /api/customers/:id/profitability`) is live. Needs a chart-y breakdown page under `/customers/:id`.
- **Mobile EAS native rebuild** — requires Apple Developer account. Unblocks voice + camera features.
- **FW Touch 2 / Follow-up templates** — follow-up outreach copy for non-responders. Same template structure, different timing and hook.

---

## Deploy Process

Deploys are **fully automated** via GitHub Actions. After every push to `main`:
1. CI runs tests (auto)
2. Deploy workflow builds frontend on runner, SCPs dist to VM, restarts backend (auto)
3. Health check passes → green deploy

**Manual emergency restart:** `vm_exec: pm2 restart sovern-erp`

## Infrastructure Notes

- **ERP server:** GCP VM `sovern-erp`, project `local-iterator-495008-e6`, zone `us-central1-f`
- **DB:** SQLite at `/home/alex/sovern-erp/data/erp.db`
- **Git repo:** `github.com/SovernHouse/sovern-erp` (public — never commit keys/credentials)
- **Admin login:** `alex@sovernhouse.co` (`.co` not `.ca`)
- **Mobile app:** `mobile/sovern-ops-app/` — Three-Surface Rule: every desktop feature ships to mobile same commit
- **VM SSH (MCP):** Two keys in VM `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` — `sovern-mcp@claude` (Windows Cowork) + `alex-mac@sovern-erp` (Mac)
- **Claude `-p` invocation rules:** `--system-prompt`, `--strict-mcp-config`, `--permission-mode bypassPermissions`, user prompt via stdin
